        <h3> Ingredientes</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs, or more as needed </li>
        <li>40 saltine crackers, smashed </li> 
        <li>4 thin slices boneless round steak </li> 
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying </li>  
     </ul>
     	<h3>Pasos a seguir</h3>
     <ol>
     	<li>Crack eggs in a medium bowl and beat slightly with a fork or whisk. Set aside. Place smashed crackers on a plate big enough for the steak.</li>
     	<li>Season steak with salt and pepper and soak in the beaten egg. Transfer to the smashed crackers and cover both sides with the crackers using a spoon; you can press a little bit with the spoon so that the crackers stick better.</li>
     	<li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom half of the steaks. Cook 2 steaks in the hot oil until crackers have turned light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and continue to cook until golden and meat is no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining steaks.</li>
